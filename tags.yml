# how do we want our tagging to work? 
# -- this is just tagging for device, other attributes come later
# how do we want to use it
# suzieq
# * each device is in a namespace
# * namespaces can be grouped together
# * the easiest way is by regex, but could also list them out
# * namespaces can be in many groups
# * devices can have a list of roles
# do i want an idea of how roles are related to each other?
# * ie containers
# * maybe we don't need that yet, do we?
# can we get away with role_group as well as namespace_group
# how do we want to define these?
# we could have each device have to list it's namespace and groups
#  that's how suzieq and MfN will intgest, but it's not how I'd like 
#   to describe them if I can help it
# how do I want to go from this description to something useful?
#  just create a static output? but with regex I don't know what will match the regex

# describe here, then have a script that edits suzieq config based on this?
#  I think this is the only trick part of the problem, how do we go from this simple setup to using it?

# I want to be able to filter by namespace (or namespace_group) and by role (or role_group)
